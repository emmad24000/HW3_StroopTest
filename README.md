A Stroop test is a reaction test where the user is shown a word that is a color, and this word has a different text color.
The user must select the button that corresponds with the text color. This is an Android app that implements this idea.
The user is given the prompt and must select the correct button; the incorrect and correct responses are displayed on the screen.
